  			<h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm from Chicago. I grew up in a vibrantly multicultural environment, bouncing between Chicago, San Francisco, and Taipei.</p>
        <p>I studied architecture and human-computer interaction University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and had studied abroad at Tongji University in Shanghai, China. During university, I was involved with <a href="http://designforamerica.com/" target="_blank">Design For America</a>, an organization that advocates human-centered design for tackling social problems.</p>
        <p>I was a designer at Booking.com for one and a half years, where I worked on conversational interfaces and product expansion. Currently, I consult for various startups.</p>

  			<h2>Design technologist?</h2>
        <p>A design technologist is also known as a full-stack designer. I have a strong technical and non-technical skillset centered on design but also reaching across research and development.</p>

        <p>In collaborative environments, I work in a deeply-integrated manner with researchers and engineers. In more independent settings, I am capable of flexing between the three domains.</p>
