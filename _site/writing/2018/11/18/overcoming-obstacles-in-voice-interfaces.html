        <p>The fundamental usability limitations of voice interfaces can be overcome through smart design.</p>

<p>Messaging assistants communicate using text, so one could reason that the information bandwidth (or information transfer rate) of messaging assistants are on par with that of traditional webpages. But the interface context in which users interact with messaging assistants effectively, though not necessarily, limits information transfer to small blocks.</p>

<p>It’s not all doom and gloom for general conversational interfaces. There are also advantages to conversational interfaces that compensate for their drawbacks and even make them uniquely effective in certain scenarios.</p>

<h3 id="overcoming-limited-information-bandwidth-or-low-information-transfer-rate">Overcoming limited information bandwidth (or low information transfer rate)</h3>
<p>You can read text faster (comfortably between 250 and 600 WPM) than you can listen to and comprehend words (comfortably around 150 to 160 WPM) spoken by an artificial voice assistant. You can hop on a product webpage on Amazon.com and devour hundreds of product detail lines in minutes. If you asked a voice assistant to explain the same product to the same level of detail, then you better grab a drink and sit yourself down someplace comfortable because you’re in for a long and boring machine monologue.</p>

<p>And in an extremely stimuli-driven e-commerce world, that’s absolutely not competitive.</p>

<p>Messaging assistants communicate using text, so one could reason that the information bandwidth (or information transfer rate) of messaging assistants are on par with that of traditional webpages. But the interface context in which users interact with messaging assistants effectively, though not necessarily, limits information transfer to small blocks.</p>

<p>I write “effectively, though not necessarily” because it is technically possible for a messaging assistant to send a 5,000-word text block. In the context of a messaging chat view frame—Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or some other messaging application—such a 5,000-word text block would overflow the view frame and thereby become difficult to parse. Furthermore, it would disrupt the conversation flow and violate the rule of reciprocity that governs normal social conversations.</p>

<p>The bottomline is that conversational interfaces, voice and non-voice, need to get the job done with fewer words.</p>

<h3 id="information-compression-talk-less-say-more">Information compression: talk less, say more.</h3>
<p>To compensate for limited information volume, the density and quality of information communicated by a messaging assistant must and can be increased.</p>

<p>Now, this entire time we’ve been comparing conversational interfaces against traditional graphical interfaces. We might think, “well, it’s fine and all to increase information density, quality, and relevance, but isn’t this also possible for traditional graphical interfaces? While it’s fine that a voice or messaging assistant like Alexa can communicate a small volume of high-quality information, it’s better that a graphical interface can display a large volume of similarly high-quality information.” But we’ve yet to examine what constitutes quality for information.</p>

<p>There are several dimensions to information quality: accuracy, depth of detail, and relevance to the whomever is seeking the information.</p>

<p>One way to increase information density and quality is to imbue the conversational assistant with authority</p>

<h3 id="agent-without-agency">Agent Without Agency</h3>
<p>A webpage is lifeless and inert and does not purport to understand or try understanding its user. It is passive, waiting to be acted upon by its user. In contrast, a conversational assistant is a machine that masquerades as an agent behind a keyboard. By doing so, a conversational agent borrows expectations that users have for a human agent.</p>

<p>A living, breathing, and thinking human agent does not idle in thought. A human agent can be proactive in thinking deeply about their client’s problem and coming up with solutions.</p>

<p>Current conversational agents behave as answer-and-response systems that only respond when prompted.</p>

<p>We can imbue a conversational agent with agency. An agent should monitor changing conditions surrounding the user’s problems and proactively communicate pertinent changes to the user.</p>

<p>Suppose you’re contemplating a getaway to Bali. you ask an AI flight agent for cheap flights there. They’re all over €800, so you tell the agent that they’re all too expensive and to just forget it. The agent will monitor flight prices unprompted. The next day, a €500 flight becomes available, which the agent detects. The agent then reopens the conversation with good news.</p>
