      <p>My name is Chris Wan. I‚Äôm an American product designer in Amsterdam working in technology. I have a background in architecture and human-computer interaction. üë®üèª‚Äçüíª</p>

<h2 id="background">Background.</h2>

<p>I was born and raised in Chicago where I developed a lifelong appreciation of the built and designed environment. I pursued architectural studies at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana%E2%80%93Champaign" target="blank">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a> and studied abroad at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongji_University" target="blank">Tongji University</a> in Shanghai, China.</p>

<p>I was rather idealistic during university. I was an early member of and studio lead for the now-award-winning <a href="http://designforamerica.com/" target="blank">Design for America</a> and lived in a student housing cooperative. I was interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_community" target="blank">intentional communities</a> as affordable housing solutions that can promote sustainability and foster social cohesion.</p>

<h2 id="why-architecture">Why architecture?</h2>

<p>Long ago, before university, I saw the Tietgenkollegiet, a Danish university dormitory modeled after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakka_walled_village" target="blank">Hakka walled villages</a> by Lundgaard &amp; Tranberg Architects. The dormitory is ring-shaped with shared spaces (like kitchens and living rooms) facing inward to a courtyard and private spaces facing outward. Lounging in the shared spaces, students can have visual contact with other apartments and the central courtyard. The courtyard serves as the spatial and visual focal point of the building, drawing residents to gather and socialize.</p>

<p>The building provides by design ample opportunity for passive social interactions that can lead to active interactions, leading to a higher quality of everyday life. Isn‚Äôt that amazing? Its design made me realize that good design can shape our lives for the better.</p>

<h2 id="why-human-computer-interaction">Why human-computer interaction?</h2>

<p>As I matured, I understood that I was interested in environments, not necessarily <em>structures</em>. Environments can be physical or virtual, three-dimensional (as a building) or two-dimensional (as an interface). I understood houses as interfaces that people inhabit and vice versa. This insight made me realize how many dots that there were waiting to be connected between architecture and HCI.</p>

<h2 id="design-for-a-better-world">Design for a better world.</h2>

<p>I am optimistic that, piece by piece, we can design a better world: a space that brings together two strangers who otherwise would‚Äôve walked on by, a road intersection that allows a cyclist to go home safely to her family instead of being hit by a car, or a chatroom that allows a confused teenager to begin safely exploring his identity long before he‚Äôs ready to come out to his family.</p>
